![Flandre keyboard layout](https://pls.pet/u/Screenshot_20200801_192214.png)

A ~33% keyboard intended to be used for stenography... sort of.
This keyboard throws stenography research out the window in favour
of intuition, so it probably isn't that good. Nevertheless, it's
a fun experiment.

Code here isn't guaranteed to be high quality. Read at your own
risk.
